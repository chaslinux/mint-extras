This script updates the system and installs extra software we think would be useful to Linux Mint users. It also fixes a few things we consider issues (multimedia keys, power management settings), and sets a background that represents the Computer Recycling Project.

Initially this script was intended for use with Linux Mint XFCE, but it now includes a couple of tweaks for Linux Mint Cinnamon edition as well.

The script installs the following software:
